# Contributing to Programmer-Wander

Thanks for thinking about contributing — this project is alpha and issues + PRs are very welcome.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AIWander/Programmer-Wander
cd Programmer-Wander
cargo build --release
```

Requires Rust 1.75+.

## Ground rules

- Open an issue before a big change so we can discuss approach
- Keep PRs focused — one concern per PR
- Match existing code style (`cargo fmt` + `cargo clippy` clean)
- Add a test if you fix a bug or add behavior
- Update docs (README, doc comments) when behavior changes

## Running checks locally

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --release -- -D warnings
cargo test --release
```

CI runs the same on x64 and ARM64.

## Reporting bugs

Use the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml). Include:

- Windows version + architecture (x64 / ARM64)
- Host app (Claude Desktop / LM Studio / Cowork / Claude Code)
- `programmer.exe --version` output
- Steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior
- Relevant logs from `./.programmer/logs/`
